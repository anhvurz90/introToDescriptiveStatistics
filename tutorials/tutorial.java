	INTRODUCTION TO DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS:

Lesson1: Intro to Research Methods: {
	01.Lauren's Intro Video:
	02.Quiz: Believe Results: {
		How many people I surveyed
		Who I surveyed
		How the survey was conducted
	}
	03.Quiz: Measure Memory: {
		How would you measure memory?
	}
	04.Define Constructs: 
	05.BBC Memory Test:
	06.Memory Test Description:
	07.BBC Scores:
	08.Google Accounts:
	09.Quiz: BBC Measurement:
	10.Operational Definition:
	11.Quiz: Constructs
	12.Quiz: Operational Definition
	13.Data:
		Hours slept
		Recognition Score
		Temporal Memory Score
	14.Quiz: Sleep and Memory
	15.Quiz: Influence Memory
	16.Quiz: Control for Time of Day: {
		Would you trust this data more if you know everyone had taken the test
		at the same time of day? Yes
		- Extraneous Factors (Lurking variable)
	}
	17.Quiz: Same score: {
		- Population parameter: mu
		- Sample statistics: x-bar
		- Sampling error: mu - x-bar
	}
	18.Quiz: Sample Average:
	19.Quiz: Better Sample: {
		- Question: What will make the sample statistic 
		closer to the population parameter? ---> Bigger sample
	}
	20.Randomness: {
		- Perhaps the best typical example that we can give of 
		the scientific meaning of random distribution is afforded 
		by the arrangement of the drops of rain in a shower. 
		No one can give a guess whereabouts at any instant 
		a drop will fall, but we know that if we put out a sheet 
		of paper it will gradually become uniformly spotted over;
		and that if we were to mark out any two equal areas on 
		the paper these would gradually tend to be struck equally often.
					- John Venn, 1888
		
		---> random sample -> x-bar has chance to be the same as mu
	}
	21.Quiz: Visualize Relationship: {
		- Ox: Hours slept
			( independent variable or
			 preditor variable)
		- Oy: Temporal Memory Score
			( dependent variable or
			  outcome)
		
		- What can we say about the relationship between hours slept
		and temporal memory score?
		 ---> The more you sleep, the better your temporal memory score
	}
	22.Quiz: True or Not? {
		Is it necessaryly true that if you go to bed early,
		your memory will definitely be better tomorrow?
		 ---> No,
		Correlation does not prove causation.
	}
	23.Golden Arches Theory:
		- Correlation does NOT IMPLY causation
		- Thomas Friedman:
			No 2 countries with a McDonald's hae ever
			gone to war since opening the McDonald's
			(Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention)
	24.McDonalds's
	25.Quiz: World Peace: {
	}
	26.Causal Inference: {
		- Show relationships -> Observational studies 
							Surveys
		- Show causation -> Controlled experiment
	}
	27.Quiz: Benefits of Surveys: {
		- Easy way to get info on a population
		- Relatively inexpensive
		- Conducted remotely
		- Anyone can access & analyze survey results
		
		Education Longitudinal Study:
			Effort <-- Enjoy school, Value school,
					Teachers, Gender, 
	}
	28.Quiz: Downsides of Surveys: {
		- Untruthful responses
		- Biased responses
		- Respondents not understanding the questions
		- Respondents refusing to answer
	}
	29.Quiz: Placebo: {
		- Active pill, inactive pill -> people
		- What is the purpose of the inactive pill?
			+ To have a comparison group to those who took the active pill
	}
	30.Quiz: Blind: {
		- Why are participants NOT told which pill they received?
			+ To make them all believe they are receiving medication
		
		- Not letting the participants know which treatment they received 
		is called 'Blinding'
		
		- In this case, "inactive pill" = "Placebo"
	}
	31.Quiz: Double Blind: {
		- Sleep Lab
		- Should the researchers observing quality of sleep know
		which treatment participants received?
			+ No, because if they know, their judgements may be biased.
		---> Double blind: Neither participants nor Researchers know the 
				treatment condition.
	}
	32.Quiz: Controlled Factors: {
		- What factors did this experiment control for?
			+ Time at which participants took the pill
			+ The place at which participants sleep
			+ What the pill look like
	}
	33.Random Assignment: {
		- Gender
		- Age
	}
	34.Quiz: Control for What? {
		- If we did 2 memory tests on each person - one after sleeping a little,
		the other after sleeping a lot - and compared the results, what would
		we be controlling for?
			- Variation in people's individual memory capabilities
